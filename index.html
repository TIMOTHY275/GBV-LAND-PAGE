        <h2>WHAT IS GENDER BASED VIOLENCE (GBV)?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>gender-based violence (GBV) encompasses any harmful act perpetrated against an individual based on their gender, often disproportionately affecting women and girls. It includes physical, sexual, emotional, and financial abuse, and can occur in the family, community, or by institutions. GBV is a significant human rights violation and a major societal problem in South Africa. </p>
        <br>
        <p>In Polokwane Local Municipality, and throughout South Africa, Gender-Based Violence (GBV) is a serious issue with numerous reported cases. These include intimate partner violence, rape, femicide, and other forms of abuse. Several recent reports highlight the severity of GBV in South Africa, including the Human Sciences Research Council's (HSRC) national study, which reveals the prevalence of physical, sexual, emotional and psychological abuse. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Gender-based violence (GBV) remains shockingly pervasive across South Africa, according to a new report. Despite the country’s robust legal framework and policies aimed at tackling GBV, the practice is deeply rooted in societal norms and incidents continue to escalate at an alarming rate.

          On November 18, South Africa’s Human Sciences Research Council released its first national study on GBV prevalence in the country. The study highlights, among other things, societal attitudes towards gender power dynamics; the prevalence and patterns of GBV experiences among women and the perpetration of violence by men; and presents data underscoring the GBV crisis.

          According to the researchers, “the data reveals deeply ingrained gender norms and power dynamics, with strong cultural reinforcement of traditional gender roles and a troubling acceptance of male aggression and dominance.”</p>
          <br>
            <h2>GENDER BASED VIOLENCE STATISTICS IN SOUTH AFRICA</h2>
          <br>
          <p>The study surveyed a sample of households in 1,000 communities across South Africa’s nine provinces. About 10,000 people, men and women, participated in the survey. Of the women surveyed, more than 1 in 3, 36 percent, said they experienced physical or sexual violence at some point in their lives, while 24 percent reported experiencing violence by an intimate partner.

           The study also uncovered disturbing opinions held by men regarding gender roles. Nearly 70 percent said a wife should obey her husband, and 15 percent felt a husband had the right to “punish” his wife for wrongdoings. Almost 23 percent believed a wife may not refuse to have sex with her husband. Nearly 10 percent held the false idea that women are often to blame if they were raped, and 12 percent wrongly believe if a woman does not physically resist it is not rape.</p>
